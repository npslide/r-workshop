## import data to tibbles

```{r}

nh <- read_csv(file="nhanes.csv")
nh
```

## view tibbles

```{r}
#| eval: false

View(nh)
```

## Inspecting content of tibbles

- head: shows the first few rows
- tail: shows the last few rows

## table head: head

```{r}

nh %>% head
```

## table tail: tail

```{r}

  first element, and the number of columns as the second element
  (the dimensions of the object)
- nrow: returns the number of rows
- ncol: returns the number of columns

## table dimension: dim

```

## Summarize tibbles

- names: returns the column names
- str: structure of the object and information about the class,
  length and content of each column
- summary: works differently depending on what kind of object
  you pass to it. Passing a data frame to the summary() function
  prints out useful summary statistics about numeric column (min,
  max, median, mean, etc.)

## dplyr package

-   filter()
-   select()
-   mutate()
-   arrange()
-   summarize()
-   group_by()
-   glimpse()

## filter()

If you want to filter rows of the data where some condition is true, use
the filter() function.

2.  The argument is a condition you must satisfy, e.g.
    filter(symbol == "LEU1"). If you want to satisfy all of
    multiple conditions, you can use the "and" operator, &. The "or"
    operator \| (the pipe character, usually shift-backslash) will
    return a subset that meet any of the conditions.

- $==$: Equal to
- $!=$: Not equal to
- $>$, $>=$: Greater than, greater than or equal to
- $<$, $<=$: Less than, less than or equal to

## Logical operators

![](assets/transform-logical.png){fig-align="center"}

## filter: example

```{r}

nh %>% filter(Gender=="male" & Weight>=50)
```

## select

Select specific column

## select: select column

```{r}

nh %>% select(Gender, Weight)
```

## select: exclude column

```{r}

nh %>% select(-Gender, -Weight)
```

## mutate

add new column

```{r}

nh %>% mutate(BMI_2=Weight/(Height*100)^2)
```

## arrange

sort by column

## arrange by BMI ascending

```{r}

nh %>% arrange(BMI)
```

## arrange by BMI descending

```{r}

nh %>% arrange(desc(BMI))
```

## group_by

group by data in column(s)

```{r}

nh %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Race) %>% 
  ungroup
```

## summarize: function

Useful functions

- Center: mean(), median()
- Spread: sd(), IQR(), mad()
- Range: min(), max(),
- Position: first(), last(), nth(),
- Count: n(), n_distinct()
- Logical: any(), all()

## summarize

```{r}

nh %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Race) %>% 
  summarize(meanBMI = mean(BMI)) %>% 
  ungroup
```

## Glimpse

Returns a glimpse of your data

```{r}

nh %>% glimpse
```

# Missing data

## Missing values

in one of two possible ways:

- Explicitly, i.e. flagged with NA.
- Implicitly, i.e. simply not present in the data.

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```

## Implicit missing values

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return)
```

## complete record

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr)
```

## detect missing data

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) %>% 
  map(is.na)
```

## count missing data by column

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) %>% 
  map(is.na) %>% 
  map(sum)
```


## avoid missing data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}


nh$Income %>% mean
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}


nh$Income %>% mean(na.rm=TRUE)
```

:::

::::

## missing treatment: remove data

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) %>% 
  fill(year, qtr)
```

## missing treatment: last observation carried forward

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) %>% 
  fill(return)
```


## missing treatment: replace by mean

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) %>%
  mutate(
    return = replace(
      return,
      is.na(return),
      mean(return, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  )
```

## missing treatment: replace by median

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) %>%
  mutate(
    return = replace(
      return,
      is.na(return),
      median(return, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  )
```
