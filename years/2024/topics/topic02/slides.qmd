## Drug testing

- 2 new pain killer, test in 10 persons that have pain.
  - A: 8 of 10 get better.
  - B: 9 of 10 get better.

- 2 new pain killer, test in 100 persons that have pain.
  - A: 70 of 100 get better.
  - B: 79 of 100 get better.

## Hypothesis testing: statistical inference

1. Convert the **research hypothesis to null hypothesis** and try to disprove. The decide which test & tails to be used.
2. decide on a **significance level** – the probability with which we are prepared to make a wrong decision if the null hypothesis is true.
3. Experimental design & do data collection
4. Perform **requirement check** then **Calculate p-value** 
5. **Compare p-value** with a significance level then end up either accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis.
6. Interpretation

## State the hypothesis

- Parameters
  - mean $(\mu)$
  - standard variation $(\sigma)$
  - distribution
- Alternative relationship
  - not equal $(\neq)$ - two tail
  - greater than $(\gt)$ - one tail
  - lower than $(\lt)$ - one tail

## Hypotheses

<br/>

| Null (not-sig: true) | Alternative (sig: true)|
|:------------|:------------|
| $\mu = 15$ | $\mu \neq 15$ |
| $\mu \leq 15$ | $\mu \gt 15$ |
| $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ | $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ |
| $\mu_1 \geq \mu_2$ | $\mu_1 \lt \mu_2$ |
| $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 ...$ | $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2, \mu_1 \neq \mu_3 ...$ |

## Choose the test: Parametric and non-parametric

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Parametric**

- test based on parameterized distributions
  - T-Test
  - ANOVA
- More strictness
- Requirement check
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Non parametric**

- not based on parameterized distributions
  - Mann-Whitney
  - Kruskal-Wallis
- Less strictness
- No requirement
:::

::::

## Decide the significant level

<br/>
<br/>

|| null hypothesis is true | null hypothesis is false |
|----|-----------|------------|
| accept null hypothesis | Good | Type II ($\beta$) error  |
| reject null hypothesis | Type I ($\alpha$) error  | Good |

## Choosing the test

1. Choosing the test based on the hypothesis
1. Decide on the significant level & collect the data
1. Choose the parametric first
1. Checking the assumption of the test
1. Calculate p-value, confidence limit
1. Accept or reject null hypothesis

## P-Value

```{r}
#| echo: false


# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Create data for normal distribution
x <- seq(-3, 3, length=100)
y <- dnorm(x)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)

# Observed data point
observed_point <- 1.5

# P-value area
p_value_area <- seq(observed_point, 3, length=100)
p_value_y <- dnorm(p_value_area)

# Plotting
ggplot(data=data) +
  geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y), size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(-2.5), linetype="dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(2.5), linetype="dashed") +
  annotate("text", x=-2.5-0.4,y=0.2,label="Very un-likely\nobservations") +
  annotate("text", x=2.5+0.4,y=0.2,label="Very un-likely\nobservations") +
  annotate("text", x=-0,y=max(y)+0.02,label="More likely observation") + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = observed_point - .4 , y = dnorm(observed_point) - 0.08 , xend = observed_point - .05 , yend = dnorm(observed_point) - 0.12), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25,"cm")), color='red') + 
  annotate("text", x = observed_point - .75 , y = dnorm(observed_point + 0.5) , label='Observed\ndata point', color='red') +
  geom_area(aes(x=p_value_area, y=p_value_y), fill="green", alpha=0.5) +
  annotate("text", x=observed_point + 0.25, y=0.05, label="P-value", color="black") +
  xlab("Set of All Possible Results") +
  ylab("Probability Density") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), axis.ticks=element_blank())
```

## Wrong interpretation of P-Value

When the same hypothesis is tested in different studies; if P of Drug ‘A’ is smaller than drug ‘B’, then drug ‘A’ is more effective than drug ‘b’.

## choosing Statistic Testing

- **type of parameter**: mean, variance, distribution, proportion
- **number of sample group**: one, two, more
- **type of variable**: focus on continuous
- **number of independent variable**: focus on one
- **number of dependent variable**: focus on one
- **parametric vs non parametric**

## normality test: Shapiro-Wilk test of normality

$$ H_0 : data distribution = normal distribution $$
$$ H_1 : data distribution \neq normal distribution $$

```{r}

nh %>% 
  filter(Diabetes=="Yes") %>% 
  .$BMI  %>%

## Bartlett Test of Homogeneity of Variances

$$ H_0 : Var_{diabetes} = Var_{nondiabetes} $$

```{r}

nh %>%

  bartlett.test(BMI~Diabetes, data=.)
```

## t-test for a population mean (variance unknown)

- Object
  - To investigate the significance of the difference between an assumed population mean μ0 and a sample mean x ̄.

- Limitations
  1. If the variance of the population σ 2 is known, a more powerful test is available: the Z-test for a population mean (Test 1).
  2. The test is accurate if the population is normally distributed. If the population is not normal, the test will give an approximate guide.

- Example: Most of diabetic patient are overweight


## one sample T Test

$$ H_0 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} = 25 $$ 
$$ H_1 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} \neq 25 $$

```{r}

nh %>% 
  filter(Age>=18) %>% 
  t_test(response = BMI, mu = 25)
```

## one sample T Test: inferiority test

$$ H_0 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} \geq 25 $$ 
$$ H_1 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} < 25 $$

```{r}


nh %>% 
  filter(Age>=18) %>% 
  t_test(response = BMI, mu = 25, alternative = "less")
```

## one sample T Test: superiority test

$$ H_0 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} \leq 25 $$ 
$$ H_1 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} > 25 $$

```{r}

nh %>% 
  filter(Age>=18) %>% 
  t_test(response = BMI, mu = 25, alternative = "greater")
```

## t-test for two population means (variances unknown but equal)

- Object
  - To investigate the significance of the difference between the means of two populations.
- Limitations
  1. If the variance of the populations is known, a more powerful test is available: the Z-test for two population means (Test 2).
  2. The test is accurate if the populations are normally distributed. If the populations are not normal, the test will give an approximate guide.


## two sample T Test: equal variance, two-tail

$$ H_0 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} = \mu_{BMI_{nondiabetic}} $$
$$ H_1 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} \neq \mu_{BMI_{nondiabetic}} $$

```{r}

nh %>% 
  filter(Age>=18) %>% 
  t_test(formula = BMI~Diabetes, , var.equal=TRUE)
```

## t-test for two population means (variances unknown and unequal)

- Object
  - To investigate the significance of the difference between the means of two populations.
- Limitations
  1. If the variances of the populations are known, a more powerful test is available: the Z-test for two population means (Test 3).
  2. The test is approximate if the populations are normally distributed or if the sample sizes are sufficiently large.
  3. The test should only be used to test the hypothesis μ1 = μ2.


## two sample T Test: not equal variance, two-tail

$$ H_0 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} = \mu_{BMI_{nondiabetic}} $$
$$ H_1 : \mu_{BMI_{diabetic}} \neq \mu_{BMI_{nondiabetic}} $$

```{r}


nh %>%

## two sample T Test: not equal variance, one-tail

## box plot

```{r}
nhaov  %>% ggplot(data = ., # add the data
       aes(x = Race, y = BMI, # set x, y coordinates
           color = Race)) +    # color by treatment
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(~Diabetes) # create panes base on health status
```

## summarize by group

```{r}
nhaov %>%   
  group_by(Race, Diabetes) %>%  
  summarize(mean = mean(BMI)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Analysis of Varience

$$ H_0 : \mu_{BMI_{Asian}} = \mu_{BMI_{Black}} = \mu_{BMI_{White}} = \mu_{BMI_{Mexican}} = \mu_{BMI_{Hispanic}} $$

```{r}

nhaov %>% 
  aov(BMI~Race, data=. ) %>%
  summary
```

## Post-hoc

```{r}

nhaov %>% 
  aov(BMI~Race, data=. ) %>%
  TukeyHSD(which="Race")
```

## tidy Post-hoc

```{r}

nhaov %>% 
  aov(BMI~Race, data=. ) %>%

# simple linear regression

## Model

$$ BMI = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age $$
![](assets/036.png){fig-align="center"}

## Assumptions

- Non-linearity
- Heteroscedasticity
- Outlier values
- Normality of residuals

## Non-linearity

## Heteroscedasticity

![](assets/038.png){fig-align="center"}

## Normality of residuals

![](assets/039.png){fig-align="center"}
![](assets/040.png){fig-align="center"}

## plot

```{r}
nh %>%
  ggplot(aes(BMI, Age)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Fitting

```{r}

nh %>% 
  lm(BMI~Age , data=.) %>% 
  summary
```

## Model Diagnostics

```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

nh %>% lm(BMI~Age , data=.) %>% plot

```
